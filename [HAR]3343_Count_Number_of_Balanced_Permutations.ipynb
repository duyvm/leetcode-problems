        "  - For example `num = 131`, we have total `6` permutations with dupcated `131`, `113`, `311`, `311`, `131`, `113`\n",
        "\n",
        "- The problem is to find total number of **distinct** `balanced_permutation`, a subset of `total_permutations`.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Furthermore, the answer requires the number of **distinct** `balanced_permutation`, which means we must remove duplicated string number if exist\n",

        "\n",
        "- Let `sumDigits` is sum of all digits of `num`. To make `oddSum` and `evenSum` equal, `sumDigits` must be even. We can check if `sumDigits` is odd, we can return `0` immediately. It mean there is no balanced permutation of `num`\n",

        "\n",
        "    $$haftSum = sumDigits ÷ 2$$\n",
        "\n",
        "- Let `k` is the number of digits in odd indices (`1,3,5...`). Because the first digit start from even index (`0`), `k = n // 2`, regardless of `n` is even or odd.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The original problem turn into find number of combinations of selected `k` digits from a set of `n` digits  $\\binom{n}{k}$ that sum of chosen group digits `sumChosenDigits` is equal to `haftSum`. The un-chosen digits will be placed at even indices and have their sum is also `haftSum`. It is also the total number of balanced permutations of `num`\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Because the problem requires return the number of **distinct** permutations, we must remove duplicated permutation from above result.\n",
        "\n",
        "####Using tabulation dynamic programming to find number of ways to choose k digits that sum of their values equals to haft of total sum\n",
        "\n",
        "- As stated above, given `sumDigits` is even, we need to find `k` digits, which are at odd indices, from the set of `n` digits, so that sum of `k` digits is equal to `haftSum`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- We treat each digit `d` in `nums` as distinct, even they have same value. So their combinations will be different.

        "\n",
        "- We can achieve this by using dynamic programming with tabulation approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Let `dp` with size `(haftSum + 1) x (k+1)` is **2D-array** that store information of states. At `dp[i][j]`, we have state information as follow:\n",

Note that because we include `d`, so we compute from `dp[i-d][j-1]`\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The reason we start from `haftSum` and `k` is to make sure that we only consider `d` once for each `dp[i][j]` by adding it with previous state of `d[i][j]` as we moving from `dp[halfSum][k]` toward `d[0][0]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - After consider all digit in `nums`, the number of ways to find `k` digits from `n` that sum to `haftSum` is `dp[haftSum][k]`.\n",
