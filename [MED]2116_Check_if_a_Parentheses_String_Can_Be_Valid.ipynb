        "\n",
        "The main challenge is that if at any point the number of closing brackets exceeds the number of opening brackets and there are no unlocked characters available to \"fix\" the imbalance, it’s impossible to balance the string, and we return false.\n",
        "\n",
        "And to address this, we need a way to keep track of all previously encountered unlocked characters so we can use them later if needed. Thus a stack is a suitable data structure for this, because it follows the `Last In, First Out (LIFO)` principle, which works well for keeping track of unmatched brackets.\n",
        "\n",
        "To implement this, we iterate through the string, whenever we encounter an unlocked character (`locked[i] = 0`), we push its index onto the stack.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we encounter a closing bracket `)` and find that the number of closing brackets exceeds the number of opening brackets at that point, we can \"fix\" the imbalance by popping an index from the stack and treating that unlocked character as an opening bracket `(`.\n",
        "\n",
        "If at any point we need an unlocked character to balance the string but the stack is empty (i.e., there are no more unlocked characters left), it means balancing the string is impossible, and we return `false`.\n",
